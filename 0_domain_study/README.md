Temperature and Rainfall Data Analysis in Sudan

## Project Idea

This project focuses on analyzing **temperature and rainfall data** to understand weather patterns and climate changes in Sudan. The goal is to provide insights that can help farmers and communities plan agricultural activities more effectively and prepare for changing weather conditions.

## Purpose and Motivation

Agriculture in Sudan depends heavily on rainfall, and unexpected changes in temperature or rainfall patterns can lead to serious impacts on crops and food security. By studying the data, this project aims to identify trends and variations that can help predict what to expect in upcoming seasons.

The main motivation is to support **farmers and decision-makers** with reliable, data-driven insights that can guide their agricultural planning and resource management.

## Project Goals

- Collect and clean historical temperature and rainfall data for Sudan.  
- Analyze the data to find patterns, averages, and anomalies.  
- Visualize the results to make them easy to understand and use.  
- Build a simple dashboard that shows rainfall and temperature trends across years and regions.  

## Data Scope

The project will focus on:

- Historical **temperature and rainfall datasets** from trusted open data sources (for example, NOAA or World Bank Climate Data).  
- Covering **multiple years** and, if possible, different **regions in Sudan**.  

The cleaned data will be the foundation for later analysis, visualizations, and a dashboard that highlights important weather patterns and predictions.

## Expected Impact

By the end of the project, the results will help raise awareness and provide **useful climate insights** for Sudanâ€™s agricultural sector. This can support more sustainable decision-making and help local communities adapt to climate change challenges.
