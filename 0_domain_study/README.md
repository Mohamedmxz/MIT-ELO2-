# Domain Study: Temperature and Rainfall Prediction in Sudan

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical temperature and rainfall data in Sudan to understand climate trends and build a machine learning model that can predict weather patterns for the coming years. Accurate predictions can support farmers, researchers, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions that improve food security and resource planning.

## Problem Context

Sudan faces major challenges in predicting and managing climate conditions. There is limited access to reliable, organized weather data, making it difficult for local farmers and communities to plan agricultural activities effectively. Droughts and irregular rainfall patterns can severely impact crops and livelihoods.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:

- Collect and clean temperature and rainfall data from reliable sources.  
- Analyze the data to identify trends and seasonal patterns.  
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict temperature and rainfall for the next few years.  
- Present results through **visualizations and a dashboard** that make the insights accessible and actionable.

## Motivation

By providing data-driven weather insights, this project can:

- Help **farmers** plan planting and harvesting more effectively.  
- Support **researchers** in understanding long-term climate shifts.  
- Assist **local authorities** in developing strategies for water management and disaster preparedness.

## Tools and Methods

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Approach:** Data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualization

## Expected Outcomes

- A clean, well-structured dataset of Sudanâ€™s temperature and rainfall data  
- Predictive model estimating future temperature and rainfall trends  
- Visualizations and an interactive dashboard to communicate results  
- Insights that can serve as a foundation for future climate-related projects in Sudan
