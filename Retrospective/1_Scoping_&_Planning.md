# Milestone 1 Retrospective

This first milestone was about defining the project and setting a clear direction. I started by thinking carefully about what I wanted to achieve and how my work could have real value. After some research, I realized that in Sudan there is a lack of organized weather prediction systems and data use for agriculture. That insight helped me focus my project on **analyzing temperature and rainfall data** to support farmers and other sectors that depend on the weather.

I decided to scope my work around building the best possible model for understanding weather trends in Sudan. This could later become a foundation for other projects that improve local planning and resource use. I created a **five-milestone plan with deadlines**, set up a **GitHub board** to track my progress, and added a **Domain Study file** to explain my project idea clearly. I managed my time well and finished this milestone fully prepared for the next phase.

## **Key Reflections**

- **What went well:** Planning the project structure, setting realistic deadlines, and connecting the goal to real needs in Sudan.  
- **What I learned:** Scoping early saves time later and helps keep focus on the main purpose.  
- **What Iâ€™ll improve:** Start gathering and reviewing datasets earlier in the next milestone to avoid delays.  
- **Next focus:** Move into data collection and start documenting data quality and challenges.

Overall, Milestone 1 gave me clarity and confidence. I now have a strong foundation to build from and a meaningful reason driving the technical side of the work.
