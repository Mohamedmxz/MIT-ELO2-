# **Milestone 2 Retrospective**

This second milestone focused on **collecting and organizing climate data for Sudan**, mainly temperature and rainfall. My goal was to find reliable datasets that cover different regions and time ranges to support the later analysis phase.  

I explored several resources, including **NASA POWER Data Access Viewer**, **NOAA’s Climate Data Portal**, **World Bank Climate Data**, and **Kaggle open datasets**. After comparing their coverage and formats, I decided to rely on **NASA POWER** because it provides consistent long-term records with latitude and longitude selection. I used coordinates to represent five regions of Sudan (North, South, Central, East, and West), then downloaded and stored the data in CSV format for future cleaning and analysis.  

The data collection process was **challenging but manageable**. It took time to test different coordinate ranges and check data completeness, but I was able to gather enough samples for each region. I also reviewed documentation for variable names and measurement units to ensure consistency before combining the data.

## **Key Reflections**

- **What went well:** I successfully identified multiple reliable data sources, collected region-based temperature and rainfall data, and organized it into a clear structure for the next phase.
- **What I learned:** Data from different sources can vary in format and completeness, so checking metadata and variable definitions early saves a lot of confusion later. I also learned how to interpret latitude and longitude ranges to represent large geographic areas accurately.  
- **What I’ll improve:** Be more systematic in checking for missing values and document each dataset’s details (such as source, range, and update frequency) to make analysis smoother.  
- **Next focus:** Begin cleaning and exploring the data to find early trends, handle gaps, and prepare it for visualization and modeling.

Overall, Milestone 2 helped me move from planning to practical work. I now have a solid base of real climate data that will allow me to analyze weather patterns across Sudan and extract insights that support farmers and decision-makers in the next milestone.
