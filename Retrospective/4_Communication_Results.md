# Milestone 4 Retrospective

Milestone 4 focused on defining the communication strategy and building the communication artifact for the project. The two main deliverables were a document describing the target audience, capabilities, constraints, intended learning, and expected actions, and a complete communication artifact. I chose to build a website to present the project. This milestone required skills outside pure data analysis, mainly web development, audience analysis, and technical communication.

## What Went Well

I gained a solid understanding of how professional websites are built. Before starting, I invested time in learning the basics of HTML, website structure, and how front end and back end elements work together. This helped me understand why certain features break, how interactive tools connect to the page, and what realistic constraints exist in web development.

My planning process was more organized compared to earlier milestones. I wrote the website content and structure in advance in a separate document, which made the later implementation easier. The deliverable describing the audience, constraints, and intended learning came together smoothly because I had already spent time understanding who the project is for and how they would interact with it. When switching tools, I adapted quickly, learned new platforms, and completed the milestone on time.

## What Did Not Go Well

The technical workflow was unstable. My first attempt at building the website with AI produced a layout that looked acceptable, but the interactive tool failed completely. Because I edited a large amount of code manually, I could not continue debugging it without breaking more pieces. My second attempt also failed when the website crashed during debugging, and I realized that my JavaScript knowledge was not strong enough to fix the issues efficiently.

Time pressure became a serious problem. I spent a large part of the milestone learning how websites work, and by the time the technical problems appeared, I did not have enough time to implement the design I originally imagined. I had to give up several features and move to a simpler tool, Framer, which limited what I could include. As a result, the final website is functional and clear, but it is not as interactive or advanced as the original plan.

## What I Learned

I learned that web development demands more time, structure, and debugging skills than I expected. Even with AI support, understanding HTML structure, JavaScript behavior, and tool integration is necessary for stability. I also learned that separating planning from implementation is effective. Preparing the content before coding saved time and prevented mistakes. The audience analysis reinforced the importance of adapting communication style to different readers, such as Sudanese viewers, data scientists, and educators.

Most importantly, I learned that using simpler tools is sometimes the best decision when the technical requirements exceed my current skill level. This milestone expanded my understanding of front end design, user experience, and the limitations of automated website generators.

## Overall Reflection

This milestone took longer than expected and was more challenging than the previous ones, but it exposed me to entirely new skills and ways of thinking. Even though I had to simplify the final website, the process improved my understanding of communication design, web development, and technical storytelling. The difficulties showed me where my skills need to grow, and the final result is still a clear and functional communication artifact. This milestone expanded the scope of my project knowledge beyond data science and helped me see how to present my work to real audiences.
