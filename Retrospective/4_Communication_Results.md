# Milestone 4 Retrospective

Milestone 4 focused on defining the communication strategy and building the communication artifact for the project. The two main deliverables were a document describing the target audience, capabilities, constraints, intended learning, and expected actions, and a complete communication artifact. I chose to build a website to present the project. This milestone required skills outside pure data analysis, mainly web development, audience analysis, and technical communication.

## What Went Well

- Gained a solid understanding of how professional websites are built, including HTML basics, website structure, and front-end/back-end interactions.  
- Planning the website content in advance improved implementation efficiency.  
- The deliverable describing the audience, constraints, and intended learning came together smoothly.  
- Adapted quickly to challenges by switching tools and completing the milestone on time.

## What Did Not Go Well

- Technical workflow was unstable; the first AI-based website crashed and editing code manually caused further errors.  
- The second attempt also failed due to lack of JavaScript knowledge.  
- Time pressure limited the complexity of the final website; several features had to be removed.  
- The final artifact is functional but simpler than originally envisioned.

## What I Learned

- Web development requires more structure, debugging, and time than expected, even with AI tools.  
- Separating planning from implementation is effective and prevents mistakes.  
- Using simpler tools is sometimes the best solution when skills or time are limited.  
- Audience analysis is critical for adapting communication style.

## Overall Reflection

This milestone took longer than expected and was challenging, but it exposed me to new skills and ways of thinking. Simplifying the website still resulted in a clear and functional communication artifact. The milestone expanded my understanding of communication design, web development, and technical storytelling, and highlighted areas where my skills need improvement.
