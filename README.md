# ELO2 Project: Temperature and Rainfall Data Analysis in Sudan

This project analyzes **temperature and rainfall data** to understand weather patterns and climate changes in Sudan. The goal is to provide insights that help **farmers and communities** plan agricultural activities more effectively and prepare for climate variability.  

The work involves collecting and cleaning weather data, performing exploratory data analysis, and creating **visualizations and a dashboard** to show long-term trends. In later stages, a **machine learning model** will be developed to **predict future temperature and rainfall patterns**, supporting data-driven decision-making in agriculture and climate planning.  

## Current Progress

- âœ… **Milestone 1 (Scoping & Planning):** Domain study completed  
- ðŸ”„ **Next Step:** Start data collection and documentation  

### Tools

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and exploration
