# Communication Artifact

This website was created to communicate the goals, methods and early findings of my project on climate predictions in Sudan. The aim is to give a clear overview of how temperature and rainfall behave across different regions and to show how data science can support better climate understanding and future planning.

The site presents the full workflow, the datasets used, the main insights from the analysis and the possible next steps for improving the predictive models. It acts as an accessible summary that complements the technical work in the project repository.

## Target Audience

**Primary**  
Sudanese viewers interested in understanding local climate trends, and data scientists who work on climate modeling or environmental analysis.

**Secondary**  
Students, mentors and reviewers who want a simple and visual explanation of the project without reading code or notebooks.

## Core Message

Clean data and simple models can already reveal useful climate patterns in Sudan, and this project can become a more advanced climate prediction tool as it grows.

## Artifact

### Website Overview

The website gives a guided tour of the project. It includes the main sections in a simple way that does not require a lot of technical knowledge.

#### **Main Sections**

- Project workflow from data collection to results  
- Methods used to build the datasets  
- Findings about rainfall variability, temperature patterns and regional differences  
- Visual summaries of annual and monthly trends  
- Plans for future improvements  
- Contact links for feedback or collaboration  

**Why a Website**  
A GitHub repository is not easy for general audiences to explore. The website provides a single place where people can understand the project quickly, view key plots and read the story behind the analysis. It works well for presentations and communication.

### Why Framer Was Chosen

I first attempted to build a more advanced site with visuals and interactive tools that take user inputs and return simple predictions from CSV data. This required front end skills in JavaScript and CSS that I begin to learn in this milestone but it wasn't enough.
I created two versions with AI assistance, but both failed to deliver a working tool. One could not run the input feature at all, and the other became unstable because the HTML could not connect correctly to the CSS and JS files and needed a lot of debugging.

Framer allowed me to deliver a simple, clean and complete communication artifact without fighting technical issues. It made it possible to focus on clarity instead of debugging front end code.

## Intended Use and Value

This website works as a simple entry point into the project. It helps viewers understand the motivation, results and direction like a presentation without reading code. It also makes it easier for people to reach out if they want to discuss ideas or collaborate.

It will continue to evolve as the project grows and as more data, features and models are added.
